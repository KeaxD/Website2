      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Keanu, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my online portfolio.
        As a full-time student majoring in Computer Science at Brigham Young
        University - Hawaii, I'm always exploring the latest developments in
        technology and finding new ways to apply my skills to real-world
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm driven by a commitment to excellence, integrity, and service. In all
        aspects of my life, I strive to embody the values of appreciation,
        gratitude, and diligence. Whether I'm tackling a complex programming
        problem or volunteering in my community or in my church, I bring a sense
        of purpose and passion to everything I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm an avid learner and a curious explorer
        of the world. I'm always seeking out new experiences, whether that means
        trying out a new programming language, exploring a new hiking trail, or
        learning about a new culture. I'm an avid explorer, a lover of thrill
        and adrenaline, and a passionate believer in Christ. I believe that by
        broadening our horizons and challenging ourselves to learn and grow, we
        can make the most of our time on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my studies and work, I'm particularly interested in the fields of
        Artificial Intelligence and cyber security, and I'm excited about the
        potential of these technologies to change the world. I believe that
        technology has the power to create a more equitable and sustainable
        future, and I'm committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a
        positive impact on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        My online portfolio showcases my work, achievements, and aspirations,
        and I'm excited to share it with you. Whether you're a potential
        employer, a fellow student, or just someone interested in technology, I
        hope that my portfolio inspires you and gives you a sense of who I am
        and what I'm passionate about. Thank you for taking the time to learn
        more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
