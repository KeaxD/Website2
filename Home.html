          I am a full-time student at Brigham Young University - Hawaii,
          majoring in Computer Science. I strive to live by principles of
          appreciation, gratitude, and diligence. Computer Science definitely
          taught me the virtue of patience too. I aim for excellence in my
          grades and behavior which enabled me to receive a full scholarship at
          BYUH. My online portfolio showcases my skills, accomplishments, and
          aspirations, and I invite you to explore it to learn more about me and
          my work. Thank you for your interest and support.

          As I continue to pursue my education and career in Computer Science, I
          am driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving. I believe
          that technology has the power to transform the world and make it a
          better place for everyone, and I am excited to be a part of this
          journey.

          I am particularly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
          We are currently seeing its influence with recent technologies and I
          believe that AI has the power to unlock new possibilities and I am
          excited to explore these possibilities as I continue to learn and
          grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I am also passionate about cyber security and its role in
          ensuring that our technology is safe and secure. With the increasing
          prevalence of cyber attacks, I believe that it is crucial to stay
          up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and to work
          towards creating a secure online environment for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience in Java, Python, and C++, and I am always looking
          for new and challenging projects to undertake. I believe that hands-on
          experience is key to developing a deep understanding of technology,
          and I am excited to apply my skills to real-world problems.
